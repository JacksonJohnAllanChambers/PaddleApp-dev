# PaddleApp - Dragon Boat Team Management iOS Application

**Developer:** Jackson Chambers  
**Tech Stack:** SwiftUI | Firebase | iOS Development  

## 🚀 Project Overview

PaddleApp is a comprehensive iOS application designed specifically for dragon boat racing teams, providing seamless team management, athlete coordination, and coaching tools. Built with modern SwiftUI architecture and Firebase backend integration, this app demonstrates full-stack mobile development capabilities with real-time data synchronization.

## 🎯 Key Features & Achievements

### 🔐 **Advanced Authentication System**
- Implemented Firebase Authentication with role-based access control
- Dual registration paths for Athletes and Coaches with differentiated permissions
- Secure password validation with real-time form validation
- Account management including deletion with proper data cleanup

### 👥 **Team Management Platform**
- **Team Creation**: Coaches can create and configure new dragon boat teams
- **Smart Team Joining**: Athletes can join teams using unique team IDs
- **Member Management**: Real-time team roster updates with Firestore integration
- **Role-Based UI**: Adaptive interface based on user type (Coach/Athlete)

### 📊 **Dynamic Dashboard System**
- **Performance Analytics**: Custom circular statistics components displaying:
  - Weekly distance tracking (Kms)
  - Stroke rate averages (SPM)
  - Speed metrics (Km/Hr)
- **Activity Management**: Timeline view for upcoming and previous training sessions
- **Team Overview**: Grid-based team cards with cover image support

### 🏗️ **Robust Architecture & Data Management**

#### **MVVM Design Pattern**
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated ViewModels
- Observable objects for reactive UI updates
- Protocol-oriented programming for form validation

#### **Firebase Integration**
- **Firestore Database**: Real-time team and user data synchronization
- **Cloud Storage**: Image handling for team logos and profile pictures
- **Security Rules**: Proper data access control implementation

#### **Data Models**
```swift
// User model with role-based functionality
struct User: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: String
    let fullname: String
    let email: String
    let coach: Bool
    var crews: [String]
    var initials: String // Computed property for UI
}

// Team management with extensible structure
struct DragonBoatTeam: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: String
    let crewname: String
    let coachname: String
    var members: [String]
    var coverImageURL: String?
}
```

### 🎨 **Modern UI/UX Implementation**

#### **Custom Components Library**
- **InputView**: Reusable form input component with validation states
- **SettingsRowView**: Consistent settings interface elements
- **TeamCardView**: Interactive team display cards with async image loading
- **StatisticCircle**: Performance metric visualization components

#### **Navigation Architecture**
- Custom tab bar with floating action button for activity recording
- NavigationLink-based routing with programmatic navigation
- Modal presentation for team creation and joining workflows

### 🔄 **Real-time Features**
- Live team member updates using Firestore listeners
- Instant UI updates when teams are joined or created
- Real-time activity feed (framework implemented for future expansion)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Highlights

### **State Management**
- `@StateObject` and `@EnvironmentObject` for app-wide state
- `@Published` properties for reactive data binding
- Proper lifecycle management with async/await patterns

### **Error Handling & Validation**
- Comprehensive form validation with visual feedback
- Graceful error handling for network operations
- User-friendly error messaging and confirmation dialogs

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Lazy loading for team grids and large data sets
- Efficient image caching with AsyncImage
- Minimal Firebase reads through strategic data fetching

### **Testing Infrastructure**
- Unit test framework setup with Testing framework
- UI test implementation with XCUITest
- Preview-driven development for component testing
